# hello-world

Hey I'm Ryan Cooke from San Diego! I have six years of experience authoring thread-safe code by using the Task Parallel Library and  threading primitives such as locks, monitors, the [Synchronization] attribute, as well as the new C# async and await.
I also have experience using delegates types to invoke a method in an asynchronous manner.
